This application will generate twitter cards that describe bills in the TX Legislature. When you visit the webpage, it will redirect you to the txlegis website.

The idea is that you could link to a URL (possibly when a bill is introduced, or maybe when at some point later in the bill's life), get a social media-friendly site with meta tags to make twitter cards, but then when you click on the link you get taken to the real website about the bill.
