<h1>About</h1>
<p>This app allows users to share social media-friendly URLs  about Bills that have been filed in the Texas Legislature during the current legislative session. When you share a URL from this site, you'll get a "card" like the one below.</p>
<img class="img img-rounded" id="sample_card" src="/img/sample_card.png">

<p>Our goal is to increase citizen engagement in our state's legislative process by making it easy to share information about bills on social media. </p>

<p>For more complete information about specific bills (such as summaries and history), we invite you to visit the Texas Legislature Online, which is linked to from each bill's page, or visit one of several other websites dedicated to those purposes.  Here is a sampling of those websites: </p>
<ul id="resources">
    <li><a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/">Texas Legislature Online</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://legiscan.com/TX">LegiScan TX</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://apps.texastribune.org/85th-texas-legislature/">Texas Tribune Guide</a></li>
</ul>


<p>We aren't trying to replace the many websites which provide summaries or the history of a bill. For the latest information about a bill, visit <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/"> the Texas Legislature Online</a>, which is linked to from each bill's page.</p>
<p>Instead, we want to increase engagement in our state's legislative process by making it easy to share information about bills on social media.</p>
